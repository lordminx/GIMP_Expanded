Inspired by a [great toot](https://mastodon.social/@wakest/100847199159835367) by Mastodon user [@wakest](https://mastodon.social/@wakest) and driven by a pathological need to drive every joke into the ground by overdoing it, here is the expansion of the [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) acronym, blown up to the size of a NaNoGenMo submission. (50000+ words)

I wanted to make it into a nicely formated pdf but it's late and I'm tired.

**TODO:**

* Autogenerate a pdf
* pretty layout
* Added Fun: Start collapsing the expanded text down to acronyms again midway for nice symmetry.
* Added Fun: Randomly collapse and expand the acronyms based on some noise function.
